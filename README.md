# 3D Table Configurator

This is a 3D table configurator built with Next.js, showcasing my skills in frontend development and 3D web applications. The app allows users to design a table in real time by customizing the table top size, legs height, and table top material.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe programming language for robust development.
- **Three.js**: Library for creating and displaying 3D graphics.

## Getting Started

To install the dependencies, run one of the following commands: `npm install`, `yarn install`, `pnpm install`, or `bun install`.

To start the development server, use one of these commands: `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, `pnpm dev`, or `bun dev`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application. The default port is `3000`.

You can edit the application by modifying the file `/src/app/page.tsx`. Changes to this file will automatically update the app during development.

The project is deployed on Vercel, and you can access the live application here: [3D Table Configurator](https://digital-tails-assessment.vercel.app/).
